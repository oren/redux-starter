Fetch data from the server
  create an action, which fetches from your api
  a reducer that responds to that action settin the app state
  create a connect to fetch from state and render

  api fetch example
    https://github.com/rackt/redux/tree/master/examples/real-world
  very real-world example, but work in progress. It calls a websockets based api
    https://github.com/binary-com/binary-next-gen

mock the API
  You can have a class / function that fetches the data and then calls dispatch to change the state
  Try mock data, but real async code + dispatch, for example call the dispatch from a setTimeout(func, 2000) so you can see how the data retrieval and state change work
