  api fetch example
    https://github.com/rackt/redux/tree/master/examples/real-world
  very real-world example, but work in progress. It calls a websockets based api
    https://github.com/binary-com/binary-next-gen

mock the API
  You can have a class / function that fetches the data and then calls dispatch to change the state
  Try mock data, but real async code + dispatch, for example call the dispatch from a setTimeout(func, 2000) so you can see how the data retrieval and state change work

css
  some people use radium, some other css modules, some other sass/less classical css


Fetch data from the server using redux
  1. create an action, which fetches from your api
  2. a reducer that responds to that action setting the app state
  3. create a connect to fetch from state and render

  redux is a flux implementation
  In a flux architecture you have stores, which are singletons that store your app state/data from api etc...
  your components consume data from such stores but do not mutate directly their state, they request for mutations to happen, the store then "does something" and produces a new state for the
  component(s) that subscribe to it to consume
  (such requests are called actions)
  in redux, there's a single store for everything, and you can "subscribe" (read+ notification when it changes) to parts of the store tree
  so in your specific case what happens in a flux structure is
  your component asks thru an action for some data to be fetched and for the state to be modified as this new data having landed, and then by subscribing to that part of the store that is going
  to have all the data that you requested to be changed, will be notified
  so for example, your store initial state will be something like `{ users: [] }`
  your components calls an action "fetchData"
  fetchData fetches from the api and tells the store "hey i got this bunch of data for you"
  at that point your reducer which will respond to the action produced by fetchData
  will produce a new state `{ users: [ { foo: 'bar'}, {baz: 'foo'}]`
  and since your component is subscribed to state.users (thru connect), you'll get a new set of props for user

  so my component need to call fetchData action, the action will call the API. when the data is returned, state.users is assigned, and my component will get updated

  in redux you normally either bind an action to the dispatcher or call `store.dispatch(action(someparams))`

  sure, probably a better way would be to have function inside your actions/index.js like `function fetchData() { return { type : 'FETCH_STUDIES' }; }`
  then call it `this.props.dispatch(fetchData());`
  so you can reused it somewhere else, but yeah fundamentally it's the same thing

misc
  https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk
    thunk allows you to do a lot more, but in a nutshell - you can dispatch other actions from inside an action
  https://github.com/acdlite/redux-actions
    redux-actions is just a helper to make it easier/cleaner to write your actions


so for the `react-redux-starter-kit` you should be able get going pretty quick. just look at `src/views/counter.js’ and `src/reducers/counter.js` and the example that
comes with it should make sense
the routes folder contains the route definitions (it uses `redux-router`). you can get to that when you have time—you can do redux before you need to actually use
that.
i don’t really get why there is `layouts` and `views` folders. I just delete those and use a `components` folder

that repo doesn’t come with an `actions` folder though—you’ll need to create that, and put your action creators in there if you want (just like how the `redux` docs
suggest)
look at redux docs. `redux-thunk` is probably the best solution.
but basically you’ll have an action creator that initiates the async call and dispatches actions for progress. so it will dispatch `FETCH_STARTED`, and then
`FETCH_SUCCESS` when the `fetch` is resolved
the action creator function that calls dispatch those 2 times is just called once in the view though.

`connect` is the glue between `redux` and a `react` component
